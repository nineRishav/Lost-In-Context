## Overview

![Project Illustration](assets/main.png)


This repository contains the code and supplementary materials for our paper *"Lost in Context: The Influence of Context on Feature Attribution Methods for Object Recognition,"* accepted at ICVGIP 2024. Our research highlights the significant impact of context on feature attribution methods used in explaining object recognition models, providing insights into the vulnerabilities of these techniques in real-world scenarios.

## Abstract

Contextual elements can heavily bias feature attribution methods, leading to unreliable interpretations and reducing the trustworthiness of AI systems. We present a comprehensive analysis of how these biases manifest and offer guidance for developing more robust and context-aware explainability frameworks.
